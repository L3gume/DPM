# DPM labs and project

This is all the labs from the Design Principles and Methods class (ECSE 211) at McGill.  
The labs are about building robots with lego Mindstorms kits and the lejOS operating system for the EV3 brick.  

## Installation

* Clone repo into directory of choice
* Use the repo as your eclipse workspace (yes, eclipse...)

**It is recommended to use the lejOS eclipse plugin for easy deployment**

I am currently working on an intelliJ plugin. I am currently in a very busy semester so it might take a while before it is in the same state as the eclipse version.
